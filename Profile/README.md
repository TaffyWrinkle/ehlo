## Description

The Windows PowerShell profile is a special .ps1 file that PowerShell will load when you initially start your session. PowerShell will automatically load any aliases, function, or variables defined in this file. The profile can be defined on a per system or per users basis. For more in depth information on the Windows PowerShell profile check out this MSDN article http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613488.aspx .

For my profile.ps1 I wanted to cover some of the basics and eliminate some of the annoyances that I was having when working with my systems. So I wrote six small functions that help me with the day to day workings of Exchange in PowerShell.

This is a Profile.PS1 script that goes with the Exchange 2007 Scripting corner post which you can find on this link:
